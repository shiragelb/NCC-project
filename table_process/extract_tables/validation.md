# Validation Process

## What We Did

We performed a bidirectional validation of the Hebrew table extraction pipeline to ensure accuracy:

### Validation Method

1. **Random Sampling**
   - Generated random samples from the extracted tables database (`tables_summary_final.json`)
   - Created 4 PDF checklists for independent validators (Shora, Suf, Elisheva, Shaul)
   - Each validator received:
     - 10 randomly selected table keys to verify
     - 10 random (page, chapter, year) combinations to check

2. **Bidirectional Testing**
   
   **Direction 1: Data → Source**
   - Took extracted table entries from our database
   - Verified each exists in the original Hebrew yearbooks
   - Checked that table headers match exactly
   
   **Direction 2: Source → Data**  
   - Went to random pages in the source documents
   - If a table existed on that page, verified it was captured in our extraction
   - If no table on the page, confirmed no false entry in our data

### Results

- **Sample Size**: 80 validation points (40 table checks + 40 page checks)
- **Accuracy**: 100% in both directions
- **False Positives**: 0 (no tables in data that don't exist in source)
- **False Negatives**: 0 (no tables in source missing from data)

### Coverage

- **Years**: 2001-2016, 2019, 2021-2024
- **Chapters**: 1-15 per year
- **Pages**: Random selection from pages 1-30

This validation confirms the extraction pipeline is working correctly with complete accuracy.
